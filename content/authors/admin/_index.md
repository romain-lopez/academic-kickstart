Since Fall 2021, I am a joint postdoctoral scholar at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) and [Genentech Research and Early Development](https://www.gene.com/), hosted by [Jonathan Pritchard](https://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/pritchard.html) and [Aviv Regev](https://www.roche.com/about/governance/executive_committee/aviv-regev.html). I recently obtained my PhD degree from the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at [UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Mike Jordan](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/) & [Nir Yosef](https://niryosef.wordpress.com/). My research interests lie at the intersection of statistics, computation and modeling with a focus on biological applications. 

A significant part of my research is driven by building more statistically accurate and faster machine learning software for analyzing single-cell omics data. I developed single-cell Variational Inference ([scVI](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0230-9)), a flexible model and a scalable inference method for comprehensive analysis of single-cell transcriptomes. I co-developed [scvi-tools](https://scvi-tools.org), an open-source software suite for fully-probabilistic modeling of single-cell multi-omics data. You may learn more about these topics in my [guest lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNOkdgE4jNM&t=2783s) of the Deep Learning in the Life Sciences class at MIT. 

More generally, I am interested in the broader area of ML + Science. Deep generative models provide an appealing and flexible paradigm for learning distributions, but quite some work is needed to fully exploit them as part of a [scientific hypothesis testing pipeline](https://www.embopress.org/doi/epdf/10.15252/msb.20199198) (e.g., causality, interpretability, disentanglement, decision-making). 

Previously, I worked on counterfactual inference and offline policy learning methods in collaboration with technology companies. In 2018, I visited [Le Song](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~lsong/) at [Ant Financial]([https://www.antfin.com/index.htm?locale=en_us) in Hangzhou. In 2019, I visited [Inderjit Dhillon](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~inderjit/) at [Amazon](https://www.aboutamazon.com/research) in Berkeley. Before graduate school, I obtained a MSc in applied mathematics from [Ecole polytechnique, Palaiseau](https://www.polytechnique.edu) in 2016. Additionally, I worked as an intern at the [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu) with [Allon Klein](https://www.klein.hms.harvard.edu/) in 2016. I was born and grew up in [Bedarieux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9darieux), France.
