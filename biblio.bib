  title = {Large-Scale Differentiable Causal Discovery of Factor Graphs},
  year = {2022},
  abtract = {A common theme in causal inference is learning causal relationships between observed variables, also known as causal discovery. This is usually a daunting task, given the large number of candidate causal graphs and the combinatorial nature of the search space. Perhaps for this reason, most research has so far focused on relatively small causal graphs, with up to hundreds of nodes. However, recent advances in fields like biology enable generating experimental data sets with thousands of interventions followed by rich profiling of thousands of variables, raising the opportunity and urgent need for large causal graph models. Here, we introduce the notion of factor directed acyclic graphs (f-DAGs) as a way to restrict the search space to non-linear low-rank causal interaction models. Combining this novel structural assumption with recent advances that bridge the gap between causal discovery and continuous optimization, we achieve causal discovery on thousands of variables. Additionally, as a model for the impact of statistical noise on this estimation procedure, we study a model of edge perturbations of the f-DAG skeleton based on random graphs and quantify the effect of such perturbations on the f-DAG rank. This theoretical analysis suggests that the set of candidate f-DAGs is much smaller than the whole DAG space and thus more statistically robust in the high-dimensional regime where the underlying skeleton is hard to assess. We propose Differentiable Causal Discovery of Factor Graphs (DCD-FG), a scalable implementation of f-DAG constrained causal discovery for high-dimensional interventional data. DCD-FG uses a Gaussian non-linear low-rank structural equation model and shows significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods in both simulations as well as a recent large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing data set with hundreds of genetic interventions.},

	abstract = {Detecting differentially expressed genes is important for characterizing subpopulations of cells. In scRNA-seq data, however, nuisance variation due to technical factors like sequencing depth and RNA capture efficiency obscures the underlying biological signal. Deep generative models have been extensively applied to scRNA-seq data, with a special focus on embedding cells into a low-dimensional latent space and correcting for batch effects. However, little attention has been given to the problem of utilizing the uncertainty from the deep generative model for differential expression. Furthermore, the existing approaches do not allow controlling for the effect size or the false discovery rate. Here, we present lvm-DE, a generic Bayesian approach for performing differential expression from using a fitted deep generative model, while controlling the false discovery rate. We apply the lvm-DE framework to scVI and scSphere, two deep generative models. The resulting approaches outperform the state-of-the-art methods at estimating the log fold change in gene expression levels, as well as detecting differentially expressed genes between subpopulations of cells.},

	year = {2022},
	abstract = {The function of mammalian cells is largely influenced by their tissue microenvironment. Advances in spatial transcriptomics open the way for studying these important determinants of cellular function by enabling a transcriptome-wide evaluation of gene expression in situ. A critical limitation of the current technologies, however, is that their resolution is limited to niches (spots) of sizes well beyond that of a single cell, thus providing measurements for cell aggregates which may mask critical interactions between neighboring cells of different types. While joint analysis with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be leveraged to alleviate this problem, current analyses are limited to a discrete view of cell type proportion inside every spot. This limitation becomes critical in the common case where, even within a cell type, there is a continuum of cell states that cannot be clearly demarcated but reflects important differences in the way cells function and interact with their surroundings. To address this, we developed Deconvolution of Spatial Transcriptomics profiles using Variational Inference (DestVI), a probabilistic method for multi-resolution analysis for spatial transcriptomics that explicitly models continuous variation within cell types. Using simulations, we demonstrate that DestVI is capable of providing higher resolution compared to the existing methods and that it can estimate gene expression by every cell type inside every spot. We then introduce an automated pipeline that uses DestVI for analysis of single tissue slices and comparison between tissues. We apply this pipeline to study the immune crosstalk within lymph nodes to infection and explore the spatial organization of a mouse tumor model. In both cases, we demonstrate that DestVI can provide a high resolution and accurate spatial characterization of the cellular organization of these tissues, and that it is capable of identifying important cell-type-specific changes in gene expression - between different tissue regions or between conditions. DestVI is available as an open-source software package in the scvi-tools codebase (https://scvi-tools.org).},

	abstract = {Probabilistic models have provided the underpinnings for state-of-the-art performance in many single-cell omics data analysis tasks, including dimensionality reduction, clustering, differential expression, annotation, removal of unwanted variation, and integration across modalities. Many of the models being deployed are amenable to scalable stochastic inference techniques, and accordingly they are able to process single-cell datasets of realistic and growing sizes. However, the community-wide adoption of probabilistic approaches is hindered by a fractured software ecosystem resulting in an array of packages with distinct, and often complex interfaces. To address this issue, we developed scvi-tools (https://scvi-tools.org), a Python package that implements a variety of leading probabilistic methods. These methods, which cover many fundamental analysis tasks, are accessible through a standardized, easy-to-use interface with direct links to Scanpy, Seurat, and Bioconductor workflows. By standardizing the implementations, we were able to develop and reuse novel functionalities across different models, such as support for complex study designs through nonlinear removal of unwanted variation due to multiple covariates and reference-query integration via scArches. The extensible software building blocks that underlie scvi-tools also enable a developer environment in which new probabilistic models for single cell omics can be efficiently developed, benchmarked, and deployed. We demonstrate this through a code-efficient reimplementation of Stereoscope for deconvolution of spatial transcriptomics profiles. By catering to both the end user and developer audiences, we expect scvi-tools to become an essential software dependency and serve to formulate a community standard for probabilistic modeling of single cell omics.},

	year = {2021},
	abstract = {Novel experimental assays now simultaneously measure lineage relationships and transcriptomic states from single cells, thanks to CRISPR/Cas9-based genome engineering. These multimodal measurements allow researchers not only to build comprehensive phylogenetic models relating all cells but also infer transcriptomic determinants of consequential subclonal behavior. The gene expression data, however, is limited to cells that are currently present ("leaves" of the phylogeny). As a consequence, researchers cannot form hypotheses about unobserved, or "ancestral", states that gave rise to the observed population. To address this, we introduce TreeVAE: a probabilistic framework for estimating ancestral transcriptional states. TreeVAE uses a variational autoencoder (VAE) to model the observed transcriptomic data while accounting for the phylogenetic relationships between cells. Using simulations, we demonstrate that TreeVAE outperforms benchmarks in reconstructing ancestral states on several metrics. TreeVAE also provides a measure of uncertainty, which we demonstrate to correlate well with its prediction accuracy. This estimate therefore potentially provides a data-driven way to estimate how far back in the ancestor chain predictions could be made. Finally, using real data from lung cancer metastasis, we show that accounting for phylogenetic relationship between cells improves goodness of fit. Together, TreeVAE provides a principled framework for reconstructing unobserved cellular states from single cell lineage tracing data.},

abstract="In this thesis, we pursue the design of Bayesian models as well as large-scale approximate inference procedures for the analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data.

First, we rely on Bayesian statistics to formalize several central algorithmic steps of single-cell transcriptomics data analysis. In particular, we introduce single-cell Variational Inference (scVI), a deep generative model that separates technical noise from biological signal, and is readily applicable de novo cell type identification, batch effect correction and differential expression. As a follow-up work, we introduce single-cell ANnotation using Variational Inference (scANVI), an extension of scVI for sharing annotation of cells across experimental conditions. scANVI is a fully-probabilistic method for harmonizing collections of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, and therefore provides a principled way of quantifying the uncertainty of cell states annotation. The inference procedure for both methods is based on auto-encoding variational Bayes, and scales to millions of cells.  

In a second line of work, we expose two pathological behaviors of variational inference we encountered while developing scVI. First, the presence of an encoder network leads to entanglement of the latent variables, an undesirable behavior for factoring out unwanted variations from embeddings. To address this problem, we introduce the Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion (HSIC) constrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE), a generic variant of the VAE that incorporates a non-parametric measure of dependence as an explicit constraint for the variational distribution. Second, we expose the unsuitability of the variational distribution for Bayesian decision-making and introduce a simple procedure for making more accurate decisions with VAEs. In particular, we explore alternative training procedures, based on using separate variational bounds for learning the generative model and variational posterior."

abstract="We study the problem of batch learning from bandit feedback in the setting of extremely large action spaces. Learning from extreme bandit feedback is ubiquitous in recommendation systems, in which billions of decisions are made over millions of choices in a single day, yielding massive observational data. In these large-scale real-world applications, supervised learning approaches such as eXtreme Multi-label Classification (XMC) remain the standard approach despite the bias inherent in the data collection process. Conversely, previously developed importance sampling approaches are unbiased but suffer from impractical variance when dealing with a large number of actions. 
In this paper, we introduce a selective importance sampling estimator (sIS) with more favorable bias-variance tradeoff. Specifically, sIS is obtained by performing importance sampling on the conditional expectation of the reward with respect to a small subset of actions for each instance (a form of Rao-Blackwellization). We employ this estimator in a novel algorithmic procedure---named Policy Optimization for eXtreme Models (POXM)---for learning from bandit feedback on XMC tasks. In POXM, the selected actions for the sIS estimator are the top-p actions of the logging policy, where p is adjusted from the data and is significantly smaller than the size of the action space. 
We use a supervised-to-bandit conversion on three XMC datasets to benchmark our POXM method against BanditNet, a previously applied partial matching pruning strategy as well as a supervised learning baseline. Whereas BanditNet sometimes improves marginally over the logging policy, our experiments show that POXM systematically and significantly improves over all baselines."

Here we present Total Variational Inference (totalVI), a framework for the joint probabilistic analysis of paired RNA and protein data from single cells. totalVI probabilistically represents the data as a composite of biological and technical factors such as limited sensitivity of the RNA data, background in the protein data, and batch effects. To evaluate totalVI, we performed CITE-seq on immune cells from murine spleen and lymph nodes with biological replicates and with different antibody panels measuring over 100 surface proteins. With this dataset we demonstrate that totalVI provides a cohesive solution for common analysis tasks like the integration of datasets with matched or unmatched protein panels, dimensionality reduction, clustering, evaluation of correlations between molecules, and differential expression testing. totalVI enables scalable, end-to-end analysis of paired RNA and protein data from single cells and is available as open-source software.},

However, owing to various nuisance factors of variation, it is not straightforward how to compare gene expression levels across data sets and how to automatically assign cell type labels in a new data set based on existing annotations. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that our previously developed method, scVI, provides an effective and fully probabilistic approach for joint representation and analysis of cohorts of single-cell RNA-seq data sets, while accounting for uncertainty caused by biological and measurement noise. We also introduce single-cell ANnotation using Variational Inference (scANVI), a semi-supervised variant of scVI designed to leverage any available cell state annotations --- for instance when only one data set in a cohort is annotated, or when only a few cells in a single data set can be labeled using marker genes. We demonstrate that scVI and scANVI compare favorably to the existing methods for data integration and cell state annotation in terms of accuracy, scalability, and adaptability to challenging settings such as a hierarchical structure of cell state labels. We further show that different from existing methods, scVI and scANVI represent the integrated datasets with a single generative model that can be directly used for any probabilistic decision making task, using differential expression as our case study. scVI and scANVI are available as open source software and can be readily used to facilitate cell state annotation and help ensure consistency and reproducibility across studies.",

abstract = {To make decisions based on a model fit by auto-encoding variational Bayes (AEVB), practitioners often let the variational distribution serve as a surrogate for the posterior distribution. This approach yields biased estimates of the expected risk, and therefore poor decisions for two reasons. First, the model fit by AEVB may yield biased statistics relative to the underlying data distribution. Second, there may be strong discrepancies between the variational distribution and the posterior. 
We explore how fitting the variational distribution based on several objective functions other than the ELBO, while continuing to fit the generative model based on the ELBO, affects the quality of downstream decisions.
For a particular model that is amenable to analysis, we investigate how importance sampling error as well as the biases in model parameter estimates vary across several approximate posteriors when used as proposal distributions.
Our theoretical results suggest that a posterior approximation distinct from the variational distribution should be used for making decisions. Motivated by these theoretical results, we propose learning several approximate proposals for the best model and combining them using multiple importance sampling for decision-making. In addition to toy examples, we present a full-fledged case study of single-cell RNA sequencing. In this challenging instance of multiple hypothesis testing, our proposed approach surpasses the current state of the art.}}

Hence, we propose the AutoZI model, which, for each gene, places a spike-and-slab prior on a mixture assignment between a negative binomial (NB) component and a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) component. We approximate the posterior distribution under this model using variational inference, and employ Bayesian decision theory to decide whether each gene is zero-inflated. On simulated data, AutoZI outperforms the alternatives. On negative control data, AutoZI retrieves predictions consistent to a previous study on ERCC spike-ins and recovers similar results on control RNAs. Applied to several datasets and instances of the 10x Chromium protocol, AutoZI allows both biological and technical interpretations of zero-inflation. Finally, AutoZI's decisions on mouse embyronic stem-cells suggest that zero-inflation might be due to transcriptional bursting.",

abstract="Single-cell RNA-sequencing has become a widely used, powerful approach for studying cell populations. However, these methods often generate multiplet artifacts, where two or more cells receive the same barcode, resulting in a hybrid transcriptome. In most experiments, multiplets account for several percent of transcriptomes and can confound downstream data analysis. Here, we present Scrublet (Single-Cell Remover of Doublets), a framework for predicting the impact of multiplets in a given analysis and identifying problematic multiplets. Scrublet avoids the need for expert knowledge or cell clustering by simulating multiplets from the data and building a nearest neighbor classifier. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we test Scrublet on several datasets that include independent knowledge of cell multiplets.",

    abstract="Parameterizing the approximate posterior of a generative model with neural networks has become a common theme in recent machine learning research. While providing appealing flexibility, this approach makes it difficult to impose or assess structural constraints such as conditional independence. We propose a framework for learning representations that relies on Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes and whose search space is constrained via kernel-based measures of independence. In particular, our method employs the d-variable Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (dHSIC) to enforce independence between the latent representations and arbitrary nuisance factors. We show how to apply this method to a range of problems, including the problems of learning invariant representations and the learning of interpretable representations. We also present a full-fledged application to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). In this setting the biological signal is mixed in complex ways with sequencing errors and sampling effects. We show that our method out-performs the state-of-the-art in this domain.",

    abstract="Single-cell transcriptome measurements can reveal unexplored biological diversity, but they suffer from technical noise and bias that must be modeled to account for the resulting uncertainty in downstream analyses. Here we introduce single-cell variational inference (scVI), a ready-to-use scalable framework for the probabilistic representation and analysis of gene expression in single cells (https://github.com/YosefLab/scVI). scVI uses stochastic optimization and deep neural networks to aggregate information across similar cells and genes and to approximate the distributions that underlie observed expression values, while accounting for batch effects and limited sensitivity. We used scVI for a range of fundamental analysis tasks including batch correction, visualization, clustering, and differential expression, and achieved high accuracy for each task.",

abstract="Class labels are often imperfectly observed, due to mistakes and to genuine ambiguity among classes. We propose a new semi-supervised deep generative model that explicitly models noisy labels, called the Mislabeled VAE (M-VAE). The M-VAE can perform better than existing deep generative models which do not account for label noise. Additionally, the derivation of M-VAE gives new theoretical insights into the popular M1+M2 semi-supervised model.",
