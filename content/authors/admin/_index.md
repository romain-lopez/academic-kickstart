I am a fifth year PhD candidate in the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at [UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) advised by [Mike Jordan](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/) & [Nir Yosef](https://niryosef.wordpress.com/). My research interests lie at the intersection of statistics, computation and modeling. 

A significant part of my research is driven by building more statistically accurate and faster machine learning software for analyzing biological data, with a focus on transcriptomics. I am a lead contributor to [single-cell variational inference (scvi-tools)](https://scvi-tools.org), a set of tools for fully-probabilistic modeling of scRNA-seq data. To learn more about scVI, check out this [Bioinformatics chat episode](https://bioinformatics.chat/scvi) or this [feature in Nature Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0230-9). 

Aside from that, I am interested in the broader area of ML + Science. Deep generative models provide an appealing and flexible paradigm for learning distributions, but quite some work is needed to fully exploit them as part of a [scientific hypothesis testing pipeline](https://www.embopress.org/doi/epdf/10.15252/msb.20199198) (e.g., interpretability, disentanglement, decision-making). 

Previously, I worked on counterfactual inference and offline policy learning methods in collaboration with technology companies. In 2018, I visited [Le Song](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~lsong/) at [Ant Financial]([https://www.antfin.com/index.htm?locale=en_us) in Hangzhou. In 2019, I visited [Inderjit Dhillon](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~inderjit/) at [Amazon](https://www.aboutamazon.com/research) in Berkeley. 

Before graduate school, I obtained a MSc in applied mathematics from [Ecole polytechnique, Palaiseau](https://www.polytechnique.edu) in 2016. Additionally, I worked as an intern at the [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu) with [Allon Klein](https://www.klein.hms.harvard.edu/) in 2016. I was born and grew up in Bedarieux, France.
