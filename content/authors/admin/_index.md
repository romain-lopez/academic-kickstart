Starting Fall 2025, I will join the [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/) and the [Department of Biology](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/biology.html) at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/) as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Biology. Please check out the [webpage for the group](https://biologicalml.org/)!. My research interests lie at the intersection of statistics, computation and modeling with a focus on biological applications. 

In the meantime, I am still a Postdoctoral Fellow jointly appointed between [Genentech Research & Early Development](https://www.roche.com/innovation/structure/genentech) and the [Stanford University School of Medicine](https://med.stanford.edu/). I was hosted by [Jonathan Pritchard](https://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/pritchard.html) and [Aviv Regev](https://www.roche.com/about/leadership/aviv-regev). Before that, I obtained my PhD degree from the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at [UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Mike Jordan](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/) & [Nir Yosef](https://yoseflab.github.io/). 

A significant part of my research is driven by building more statistically accurate and faster machine learning software for analyzing single-cell omics data. I developed single-cell Variational Inference ([scVI](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0229-2)), a flexible model and a scalable inference method for comprehensive analysis of single-cell transcriptomes. I co-developed [scvi-tools](https://scvi-tools.org), an open-source software suite for fully-probabilistic modeling of single-cell multi-omics data. You may learn more about these topics in my [guest lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNOkdgE4jNM&t=2783s) of the Deep Learning in the Life Sciences class at MIT. 

More generally, I am interested in the broader area of ML + Science. Deep generative models provide an appealing and flexible paradigm for learning distributions, but quite some work is needed to fully exploit them as part of a [scientific hypothesis testing pipeline](https://www.embopress.org/doi/epdf/10.15252/msb.20199198) (e.g., causality, interpretability, disentanglement, decision-making). 

Previously, I worked on counterfactual inference and offline policy learning methods in collaboration with technology companies. In 2018, I visited [Le Song](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/professor-le-song/) at the [Ant Group]([https://www.antgroup.com/en) in Hangzhou. In 2019, I visited [Inderjit Dhillon](https://oden.utexas.edu/people/directory/Inderjit-Dhillon/) at [Amazon Science](https://www.amazon.science/) in Berkeley. Before graduate school, I obtained a MSc in applied mathematics from [Ecole polytechnique, Palaiseau](https://www.polytechnique.edu) in 2016. Additionally, I worked as an intern at the [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu) with [Allon Klein](https://www.klein.hms.harvard.edu/) in 2016. I was born and grew up in [Bedarieux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9darieux), France.
