I am a PhD student advised by [Mike Jordan](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/) & [Nir Yosef](https://niryosef.wordpress.com/). My research interests lie at the intersection of statistics, computation and modeling. A significant part of my research is driven by building more statistically accurate and faster machine learning software for analyzing biological data, with a focus on single-cell transcriptomics. I am the lead contributor to [single-cell Variational Inference (scVI)](https://github.com/YosefLab/scVI), a software for fully-probabilistic modeling of scRNA-seq data. I also did several internship at [Ant Financial]([https://www.antfin.com/index.htm?locale=en_us) in Hangzhou and [Amazon](https://www.aboutamazon.com/research) in Berkeley on counterfactual inference and offline policy learning methods. I was born and grew up in Bedarieux, France.
