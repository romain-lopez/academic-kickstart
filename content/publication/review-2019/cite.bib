 abstract = {Deep generative models provide coherent frameworks for reasoning about the process that simulated a given dataset. Relying on modern techniques such as neural networks and stochastic optimization, the subsequent class of algorithms learns expressive models with efficient approximate inference. Initially developed for computer vision and natural language processing applications, these models found fruitful applications to biomedicine, including molecule design, biological sequence modeling and single-cell transcriptomics. In this review, we present these applications and explain the main challenges of applying deep generative models to biomedical research.},
