 abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have enabled a greater understanding of previously unexplored biological diversity. Based on the design of such experiments, individual cells
from scRNA-seq datasets can often be attributed to non-overlapping “groups”. For example, these
group labels may denote the cell’s tissue or cell line of origin. In this setting, one important problem
consists in discerning patterns in the data that are shared across groups versus those that are group-
specific. However, existing methods for this type of analysis are mainly limited to (generalized) linear
latent variable models. Here we introduce multiGroupVI, a deep generative model for analyzing
grouped scRNA-seq datasets that decomposes the data into shared and group-specific factors of
variation. We first validate our approach on a simulated dataset, on which we significantly outperform
state-of-the-art methods. We then apply it to explore regional differences in an scRNA-seq dataset
sampled from multiple regions of the mouse small intestine.},
